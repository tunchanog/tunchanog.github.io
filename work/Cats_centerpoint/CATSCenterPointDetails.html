						<p>
							I reimagined the user experience as part of a rewrite of the existing product. I was part of the migration from the old product
							in Flex to the new HTML application. I worked alongside the development team during the redesign and also helped maintain
							the user interface for the legacy Flex product. In addition, I collaborated with marketing team to rebrand the look
							and feel of the product and provided design work such as logo design.
